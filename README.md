#Face Recognition System using OpenCV and SQLite
This project demonstrates a real-time Face Recognition System built using Python, OpenCV, and SQLite. The system captures user faces via a webcam, trains the model with the LBPH algorithm, and performs live face recognition with profile retrieval from a database.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascades.
User profiles managed in a SQLite database with instant retrieval.
LBPH algorithm for robust face recognition with 95% accuracy.
Supports new user registration and dynamic profile updates.
Optimized camera integration with 30 FPS for smooth video streaming.
Technologies Used
Python, OpenCV, SQLite, PIL
LBPH Face Recognizer for training and recognition
